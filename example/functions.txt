filevars() - Variables across files
-----------------------------------

```python
def filevars(path):
    """Returns variables, from DRY doc located in path, in dict format."""
```

You can access variables in other DRY documents with filevars() function inside Jinja2 template.
Filepaths are always relative to the document.

For example:

*example/snippets/drydoc1.txt:*

{{ include('snippets/drydoc1.txt', render=False) | indent(4, true) }}

*example/snippets/path/drydoc2.txt:*

{{ include('snippets/path/drydoc2.txt', render=False) | indent(4, true) }}

You can access dictionary's keys via attribute: dict.attr, or with normal syntax: dict['attr'].

include() - Including documents
-------------------------------

```python
def include(path, render=True):
    """Returns another document located in path. Set render=False if
    you don't want to render the document.
    """
```

Documents can be included to other documents with include() function. When document B is included from document A, document B is rendered inside document A. Including document itself results to inifite recursion loop and will fail to exception.

*list.txt:*

{{ include('snippets/list.txt', render=False).rstrip() | indent(4, true) }}

*likes.txt:*

{{ include('snippets/likes.txt', render=False).rstrip() | indent(4, true) }}

Now when *likes.txt* is rendered, it produces:

{{ include('snippets/likes.txt').rstrip() | indent(4, true) }}

You can also include normal text documents, just make sure they don't include the string which separates variable and template sections.
Normal text document must not contain a line with only '...' characters and it must not start with '...'

system() - Executing external programs
--------------------------------------

```python
def system(cmd):
    """Executes cmd in shell and returns its output."""
```

You can execute shell commands and pipe their output to the document with system() function.

For example, a DRY document which renders to output of *'ls -l'*

{{ include('snippets/ls.txt', render=False) | indent(4, true) }}

Dynamically get newest trends from Twitter in nicely formatted JSON:

{{ include('snippets/trends.txt', render=False) | indent(4, true) }}
