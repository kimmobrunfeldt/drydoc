...
DRY document is a text file with variables and templating features to prevent you from
repeating yourself throughout the document. This document was also rendered with *{{ filevars('readme.md').program_name }}*.
This document is located in *example* directory.

Document structure
------------------

{{ include('snippets/structure.txt', render=False) | indent(4, true) }}

Document starts with variable definitions. Definitions are followed by '{{ filevars('readme.md').separator }}' in its own line end the section.
Variable definitions are in YAML http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML.
Variables must be in dictionary-like format, so they can be passed to template engine.

The rest of the document, after the three dots, is rendered as a Jinja2
template, with the variables defined in the beginning.
New lines from the beginning of actual template are stripped out.

If there are no variable definitions, document must contain '{{ filevars('readme.md').separator }}' in it, for it to be recognized as a DRY document.
Rendering a document without '{{ filevars('readme.md').separator }}' separator produces the document itself.

Example
-------

DRY document:

{{ include('snippets/basic.txt', render=False) | indent(4, true) }}

Will render to:

{{ include('snippets/basic.txt') | indent(4, true) }}
